# LLM Experiments

Welcome to my repository for experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs). This project is designed to start with smaller models like **TinyLlama** and progressively move to larger architectures, exploring the concepts, optimizations, and applications of LLMs along the way.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

1. **Understand LLM Fundamentals**: Build foundational knowledge by implementing and testing small models like TinyLlama.
2. **Experimentation**: Explore optimizations in architecture, training, and fine-tuning techniques.
3. **Scaling Up**: Transition from smaller models to larger ones, while addressing challenges like memory efficiency, distributed training, and inference.
4. **Real-World Applications**: Develop pipelines for tasks like text generation, summarization, and more using LLMs.
